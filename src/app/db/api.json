      "description": "Get into the action in one of the longest running battle royale games PUBG Battlegrounds. Originally titled PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, the game has been offering players the full battle royale experience in a more realistic setting since 2017. Test yourself against 99 other players on seven different maps using whatever weapons you can find. Just be sure to be the last one standing, because that’s the only way to win.\r\n\r\nGo it alone or play with friends in groups of two or four. Start out with only the clothes on your back, loot buildings, towns, and other locations to obtain the equipment you need. This includes weapons, armor, vehicles, and more. If you want the really good gear – and it’s likely you do – you’ll have to take some risks and head to the more dangerous zones on the map.\r\n\r\nAs is generally the case with the battle royale formula, PUBG’s map shrinks over time, herding all players into a random location where they will eventually have no choice but to engage each other or risk taking damage outside the restricted area. At the same time, random areas of the map will be bombed. So, players must be aware of both events and do their best to avoid them.\r\n\r\nPUBG Battlegrounds is free-to-play and offers players purchasable items in the form of cosmetics. These do not impact game play.\r\n",

Players not only explore dungeons, but climb mountains, trees, and buildings to discover all kinds of secrets. \r\n\r\nOf course, the main character doesn’t travel alone. Instead, players build a four-player group out of over 20 characters that can be swapped out to create the best group for any particular mission. The characters, each with different skills filling out the classic RPG types as well as distinct elemental focuses, can be obtained via gameplay or the game’s gacha mechanics – as is gear. Both characters and gear are upgraded in the game via the in depth crafting system.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the game offers players an adventurer system that provides them with even more to do, be it daily quests, small favors for the locals, or big continent-traveling quests. The adventurer system also rewards players for their activities with a wide variety of items.\r\n\r\nGenshin Impact is available to players on PC, PlayStation 4, and mobile devices. It also features a multiplayer mode allowing up to four players to play together and cross-play across all four platforms, however, PlayStation 4 does not allow for cross-progression.",

Both the Humans and the Elves have their own unique city styles befitting their respective cultures.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of culture, Elvenar also boasts a Culture system that rewards players who take the time improve the happiness of the townspeople with innovative decorations around their city.\r\n\r\nBut there is more to Elvenar than simple city building and culture: combat is an integral part of the game as well. Players must raise an army to protect their fledgling town from attacks, and the turn-based combat system puts players in direct control of their forces instead of letting them auto-battle. You will decide whether or not your civilization succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\nInnoGames offers constant updates and new content for Elvenar, meaning that the gameplay and aesthetics are always changing.

The harsh, post-apocalyptic terrain of Crossout forces players to build and customize their vehicles to fight and endure the elements and other players. Hunker down in the in-game Workshop and use the countless parts earned in battle to craft a formidable death machine capable of laying waste to opponents.\r\n\r\nWeapons in Crossout range from roof-mounted miniguns to vehicular chainsaws and everything in between the player can imagine. But combat isn’t all there is to Crossout. The in-game economy is driven by the players, allowing them to trade the parts they’ve earned with one another to craft stronger, pitiless, machines. Vehicles in Crossout must be strong, for the damage a vehicle takes in battle will affect its performance. And when the enemy is charging with a vehicle-mounted powerdrill, peak performance is everything.  Crossout is everything players looking for the post-apocalyptic vehicular warfare experience could possibly want. Find a vehicle and turn it into a death-spitting chariot of war!",

You’ll pilot warplanes in exciting PvP dogfights and rumble across the battlefield in tanks, battling against foes on across several vintage maps, featuring diverse terrain and offering several strategic options. There are many different ways to play War Thunder, ranging from quick arcade mode-style combat to competitive, realistic battles.\r\n\r\nThe vehicles in War Thunder represent WWII-era tanks and planes from several different nations, including the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, and the USSR. Battles earn you currency you can use to upgrade your vehicles with better engines, weaponry, and other modifications, and you’ll also earn experience that you can use to unlock more vehicles and increase your crew’s performance. Planes include quick and agile fighters, giant flying fortresses, and precision bombers, while tanks run the gamut from light to heavy to self-propelled artillery. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses and learning how to properly use your vehicles is the key to victory.\r\n\r\nThe most common game modes are PvP battles that revolve around a series of control points or that task players with destroying enemy vehicles, whether AI-controlled or belonging to other players. Each player brings a squad of up to five vehicles and, when your current vehicle is destroyed, you’ll choose another one to ride back into combat. You can also adjust battle realism, opting for simpler controls with target reticles and other helpful guides, or complete realism, with very few artificial elements in the way of aid. In addition to PvP battles, there are also PvE campaigns and missions you can take on alone or with other players. No matter how you play War Thunder, the action will be easy to find and the battles will have you on the edge of your seat!",
